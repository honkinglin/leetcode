# Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.

# An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

# Example 1:
# Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
# Output: true

# Example 2:
# Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
# Output: false

class Solution:
    def isAnagram(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        # no extra memory 
        return sorted(s) == sorted(t)

        # Use HashMap Solution
        count = defaultdict(int)
        
        # Count the frequency of characters in string s
        for x in s:
            count[x] += 1
        
        # Decrement the frequency of characters in string t
        for x in t:
            count[x] -= 1
        
        # Check if any character has non-zero frequency
        for val in count.values():
            if val != 0:
                return False

        return True
